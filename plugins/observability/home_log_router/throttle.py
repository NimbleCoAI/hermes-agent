"""Throttle — storm control for home-channel forwarding.

Pure logic with an injectable clock so it is fully testable without sleeping.

Policy:
  * dedup     — an identical message is admitted at most once per dedup_window
                (a persistent error still resurfaces each window as a heartbeat,
                rather than flooding or vanishing forever).
  * rate-cap  — at most ``rate`` admits per ``window`` seconds; excess suppressed.
  * summary   — the first admit following any suppression leads with a short
                "N suppressed" line so operators know they aren't seeing all.
