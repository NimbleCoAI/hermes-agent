"""ReentrancyGuard — process-wide suppression while the worker is sending.

The worker forwards via ``send_message``, which (through ``_run_async``) performs
the actual platform send on a *separate* thread, and the platform adapter emits
its own log records during that send. Those records match the allowlist and would
feed back into the queue. A thread-local guard would miss the adapter's thread,
so this guard is process-wide: while active, the handler drops every record.
