"""Discord moderation → authorization propagation (R7).

When a member is banned (or, in ``remove`` mode, kicked / leaves) from a
guild, their Hermes authorization must die with the ban — otherwise a banned
user keeps DM command access through the pairing store or a stale allowlist.

Revocation removes every grant:

  1. pairing store approval + persisted ``.env`` allowlist entry
     (``gateway.pairing.revoke_platform_authorization``);
  2. the adapter's in-memory ``_allowed_user_ids`` + ``os.environ``
     mirror of ``DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS``;
  3. an exact ``GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS`` entry (cross-platform var — Discord
     snowflakes are 17-19 digits so collision risk with other platforms'
     IDs is nil);
  4. a persistent, adapter-owned **deny store** at
     ``{HERMES_HOME}/platforms/discord-denied.json``.

The deny store is the backstop for a specific failure mode: the HSM console
saves its whole env document back (stale whole-document PUT, audit SB-5/#2),
which can re-write ``DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS`` and silently re-grant a banned
user. The deny store is checked before EVERY allow branch (pairing,
allowlists, ALLOW_ALL, channel bypass, component clicks) and survives every
console save. Deny beats allow, always.

Config (read at call time):
  DISCORD_MODERATION_SYNC=ban       off | ban (default) | remove.
      "ban": bans propagate; works with default (non-privileged
             moderation) intents; zero boot risk.
      "remove": ban+kick+leave all revoke. GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE cannot
             distinguish a kick from a voluntary leave without audit-log
             permissions, and it requires the privileged Server Members
             intent (must be enabled in the Developer Portal or the bot
             may fail to boot — see the adapter's intents warning).
  DISCORD_MODERATION_SYNC_GUILDS=   comma guild ids; empty = all guilds.
  DISCORD_MODERATION_SYNC_EXEMPT=   comma snowflakes never auto-revoked
      (seed with break-glass operator ids so a test-guild departure cannot
      strand the operators).

This module NEVER posts to Discord/Telegram — revocation is silent on the
platform and loud in the logs.
