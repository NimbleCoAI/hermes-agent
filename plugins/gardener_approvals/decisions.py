"""Read OPEN decisions from the gardener decisions.md. Mirrors the gate's
`open_ids()` grep so the hook and the gate agree on what 'open' means. Real
dated ids only — the `D-YYYY-MM-DD-NN` format example is never matched.

Each open block is returned as a Decision dataclass carrying the id and,
when the block contains a Link: line that references a PR, the PR number.
