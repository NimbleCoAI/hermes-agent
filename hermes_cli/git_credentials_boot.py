"""Boot-time provisioning of per-agent git credentials.

This is the runtime-side port of HSM's ``lib/services/git-credentials.ts``.
It moves "make the agent's own GitHub token usable by git" out of the
swarm-manager and into the agent runtime, where it belongs:

  * The tool subprocess (where the agent runs ``git``) deliberately CANNOT
    see ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` — provider secrets are blocklisted from the
    subprocess env (``tools/environments/local.py`` /
    ``hermes_cli/auth.py``). So a credential file is the only path, and the
    skill that runs *inside* the subprocess can't read the raw token to
    write one.
  * This module runs in-process at container boot (a cont-init.d step),
    where the agent's ``.env`` is readable on the mounted volume and
    ``get_subprocess_home()`` (``{HERMES_HOME}/home``) is known directly.

It writes the agent's OWN token (from its ``.env``) into
``{HERMES_HOME}/home/.git-credentials`` + ``.gitconfig`` so git's ``store``
helper picks it up. Tokens never cross-pollinate — each home reads only its
own ``.env``. Creating ``{HERMES_HOME}/home`` is also what activates the
tool subprocess's HOME override (see ``get_subprocess_home``).

Mirrors ``container_boot.py``: a pure, per-home function plus a profile-aware
``provision_all`` and a ``main()`` entry point wired into the image as a
cont-init.d hook. No HSM dependence on a runtime-internal path — the runtime
owns the path now.

**Manage-if-ours, not apply-if-absent.** Provisioning originally refused to
touch any file that already existed, so that a human's own ``.gitconfig`` was
never clobbered. The rule is right; the test was wrong. "Does a file exist
here?" cannot distinguish someone else's config from our own stale output, so
every file this module wrote became permanent on the first boot that wrote it:
an installation token good for ~1h froze into ``hosts.yml`` for weeks, and a
git identity resolved before ``HERMES_AGENT_NAME`` was consulted kept authoring
commits as "data" long after the resolution was fixed. Files are now stamped
with :data:`MANAGED_MARKER`, ownership is the gate, and a file we own is
reconciled to current content on every boot. Credentials that carry an expiry
additionally record it (``# token-expires-at:``) so refresh is driven by the
token's lifetime rather than by the container's.
