"""Event-loop freeze watchdog — last-resort detection + self-heal.

A hung *synchronous* call anywhere on the gateway's event-loop thread (a
blocking socket read, a stuck subprocess, a lock held by another process)
silently stalls every coroutine at once — SSE listeners, health monitors,
message handling, the housekeeping thread's scheduled work — with near-zero
CPU, since the process is blocked on I/O rather than spinning. Nothing else
in the gateway can detect this: the SSE-specific health monitor
(``gateway.platforms.signal._health_monitor`` and its per-platform
equivalents) only notices when *its own* task stops running, which never
happens because the freeze is upstream of it too.

This module is a coarse, platform-agnostic safety net: periodically prove
the loop is still processing a trivial coroutine, and if it stays
unresponsive past a threshold, dump every thread's current stack (this
works even while the loop itself is frozen — ``faulthandler`` reads thread
state directly via the C level, it doesn't need the loop's cooperation)
and hard-exit. The gateway runs under s6 supervision in production
(``s6-supervise gateway-default``, auto-restart on crash), so a hard exit
restores service automatically instead of the process staying dead for
hours with nothing in the logs to explain why.

This does not fix the underlying freeze — it only bounds how long the
gateway stays dead once one happens, and captures the evidence needed to
root-cause it next time.
