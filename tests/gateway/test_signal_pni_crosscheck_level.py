"""The PNI/ACI self-lookup cross-check must not log at WARNING.

`_resolve_own_uuid` resolves the account's own ACI from `listIdentities` and
cross-checks it against `getUserStatus`. Per that method's docstring, signal-cli
*always* returns the account **PNI** for a self `getUserStatus` (verified on
0.14.5), so the two values always differ — the mismatch branch is the expected
steady state on every gateway start, not a fault.

It used to log at WARNING. Because `gateway.platforms.signal` is in
home_log_router's `DEFAULT_LOGGERS` and that router forwards at WARNING, every
agent on the fleet relayed this line to the operator's home channel on each
restart. That is the lifecycle spam home_log_router's own module docstring
forbids, and it made a correct code path read as a recurring failure.

These tests pin:
- the cross-check mismatch does NOT emit a WARNING (or worse)
- it IS still recorded at DEBUG, so the diagnostic is not lost
- the ACI from listIdentities wins regardless of what getUserStatus returns
