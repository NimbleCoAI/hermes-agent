"""Realistic-distribution test — the gap the unit tests + audit missed.

The live deploy found that `classify_task_type`'s catch-all default
(`TASK_ORCHESTRATION → cheap`) silently cheap-routed hard architecture questions,
multi-file code-gen requests, and hedged/ambiguous asks — violating the
"fail open to premium" guarantee. The prior tests only checked the tier MAPPING
(`tier_for_task_type(ARCHITECTURE) == premium`) in isolation, never that real
messages get ASSIGNED premium.

This test feeds a batch of REPRESENTATIVE messages through the FULL
`on_pre_llm_call` path and asserts what actually gets routed (the emitted `route`
override, or its absence) — not an explicit-type mapping.

Invariant: only a CONFIDENTLY mechanical turn emits a cheap `route`. Everything
judgment / architecture / code-gen / uncertain / hedged / public-facing emits NO
route (stays on the configured primary).
